# EV-Charging-Patterns
# User Type Prediction Based On EV Charging Patterns

The dataset utilized in this project provides a detailed analysis of EV charging patterns and 
user behaviours. Comprising 1,320 samples, it encapsulates various metrics related to charging 
sessions, vehicle details, and user habits, offering a robust foundation for predictive modelling. 
The dataset includes the following features: 
• User ID: A unique identifier for each user. 
• Vehicle Model: The model of the EV (e.g., Tesla Model 3, Nissan Leaf). 
• Battery Capacity (kWh): The total battery capacity of the vehicle in kilowatt-hours. 
• Charging Station ID and Location: Information about the charging station used. 
• Charging Start and End Times: Timestamps capturing the duration of the charging 
session. 
• Energy Consumed (kWh) and Charging Duration (hours): Key metrics reflecting 
charging behaviour. 
• Charging Rate (kW) and Cost (USD): Metrics indicative of the efficiency and cost
effectiveness of charging sessions. 
• Time of Day and Day of Week: Temporal details related to the charging session. 
• State of Charge (Start and End): Battery charge percentages at the beginning and end 
of the session. 
• Distance Driven (km): Distance travelled since the last charge. 
• Temperature (°C): Ambient conditions during the session. 
• Vehicle Age (years): The age of the EV. 
• Charger Type: Type of charger used (e.g., Level 1, Level 2, DC Fast Charger). 
• User Type: The target classification feature categorizing users based on driving habits 
(e.g., Commuter, Long-Distance Traveler). 
The dataset is designed to apply machine learning algorithms, not for traditional research 
purposes. Its main value thus lies in the creation and evaluation of predictive models.


The project's scope will be to apply, test, and possibly contrast 7 machine-learning models 
that classify EV users' type. Hence, with a data set, it includes: 
• Develop Predictive Models: Use supervised machine learning algorithms to classify 
users into distinct classes, such as “Casual”, "Commuter" and "Long-Distance 
Traveler." 
• Optimize Model Performance: Perform parameter tuning and use cross-validation 
techniques to increase the accuracy and reliability of the models' classifications. 
• Evaluate Metrics: Evaluate model performance with different metrics such as accuracy, 
precision, recall, and Area Under the Curve (AUC). 
• Document Findings: Describe in detail the characteristics of the datasets, preprocessing, 
modeling approaches, parameter tuning, and performance outcomes all supported by 
visualizations.
